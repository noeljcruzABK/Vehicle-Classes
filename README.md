# Vehicle-Classes
Create a vehicle base class, and from that create the necessary classes to get to boat, car and airplane.  All classes should have an overridable function named Drive.  Create an object of each and demonstrate the Drive function works.  Feel free to add any additional functionality to better simulate these vehicles!
